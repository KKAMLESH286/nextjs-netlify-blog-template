## *Preface*

Is the curious cat really want to feed the hunger for learning or want to utilise that learning to build things from scratch? 

This question seems pointless but fits very well in my case.

I, personally used to get a lot of deep feelings to learn new things and just go on the learning part but learning new things is not as good as practising and improvising one thing again and again. 

## ***Main story***

It's been six months working in the software industry and almost two years playing with the code. But learning languages like python, automation, web dev(HTML, CSS, JS), mobile dev(flutter), PHP, reactjs, next js seems like a never-ending task. Even picking a single language is obviously a never-ending task. So switching languages due to personal reasons or company reasons seem exciting in the first instance but not healthy for a long time. 

\    For some reason understanding the ecosystem is good but what if our choices get changed every time by hitting the new technology. If I want to build something then it must be super important to find out the requirements rather than switching the technologies.

## *Conclusion*

* First thing first, find out what is your goal?
* After deciding the goal, find out the requirements to fulfil the goal.
* Then align those requirements with your organizational needs.
* And now comes the time to learn things.
* finally practice, practice and practice.

That's how taking the goal-oriented approach solves the curious cat's problem.
