## Ask Some Questions

<!--StartFragment-->

If you encountered this question once in your life, Free will or Fate? What will you choose? Actually, I used to think alot about this question since long time but never found why I'm choosing Free will always. I would be so dumb to say that it is my fate to choose free will but... my next question is why not? Finding the answers of such questions is to rationalize something so deep.. But the next question again is why to rationalize?
